# Creational Design Patterns

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns **that 
deal with object creation mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner 
suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result 
in design problems or added complexity to the design. 
Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this 
object creation.

Types of creational design patterns are:

- [**Singleton Pattern**](./Singleton)
- [**Factory Method Pattern**](./FactoryMethod)
- [**Abstract Factory Pattern**](./AbstractFactoryPattern)
- [**Builder Pattern**](./Builder)
- [**Prototype Pattern**](./PrototypePattern)
- [**Service Locator**](./ServiceLocator)
- [**Dependency injection**](./DependencyInjection)
