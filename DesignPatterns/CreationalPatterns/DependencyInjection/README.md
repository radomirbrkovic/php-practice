# Dependency Injection Pattern

Dependency injection is a procedure where one object supplies the dependencies of another object. Dependency Injection is a software design approach that allows avoiding hard-coding dependencies and makes it possible to change the dependencies both at runtime and compile time.

## Pros and Cons

Dependency injection pattern provides:
- *Decreasing class responsibility* - because of the classes don't care about instancing objects that they will use. 
- *Code flexibility* - system is not responsible about instancing dependent object, it is client responsibility
