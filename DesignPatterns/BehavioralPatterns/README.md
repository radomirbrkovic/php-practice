# Behavioral Design Patterns

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. 

Types of behavioral design patterns:

- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- Visitor Pattern
